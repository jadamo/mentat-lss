Installation Instructions
=========================

This package works on both Linux and MacOS (intel and arm64) platforms, and has so-far been tested using **Python 3.9 - 3.11**. There are two methods to install the code.

Preliminaries
-------------

1. To enable GPU functionality for network training, make sure you have CUDA installed (or python 3.8+ if using apple silicon).
2. You will need some way to generate galaxy power spectrum multipoles to generate training sets. One option is to download and install 
   both `ps_1loop`_ and `ps_theory_calculator`_. You might need to request access to those repositories, in which case you can contact Yosuke Kobayashi 
   (yosukekobayashi@arizona.edu). We have also included a version of `FAST-PT`_ to satisfy this requirnment.

From pip (recommended)
-----------------------

In a clean enviornment, simply run,

`pip install mentat-lss`

Alternatively, if you would like to install from source 
(for example, you want to add to the package, or would like
easier access to the provided config files), you can do so in two different ways.

From source (automatic)
-----------------------

1. Download this repository to your location of choice.
2. In the base directory, simply run ``install.sh`` in the terminal. This script will create a new anaconda enviornment, fetch the corresponding version of PyTorch, and install the code, all automatically.

From source (manual)
-----------------------

1. Download this repository to your location of choice.
1. install the corresponding `PyTorch`_ version. If your machine doesn't have a GPU, you can skip this step.
2. In the base directory, run ``python -m pip install .``, which should install this repository as a package and all required dependencies.

To run the provided unit-tests, you can run the following command in the base repo directory,

``python -m pytest tests``
